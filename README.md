# Ordered Collection Diffing

This repository holds the original prototype implementing ordered collection diffing as [proposed to swift-evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/968) and [pitched in the swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/ordered-collection-diffing/18933).

This code has been adapted into a [PR against the standard library](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/21845) and now only exist as a historical artifact for the curious.
